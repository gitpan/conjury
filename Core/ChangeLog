	* (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): Removed the Conjury::Core::Stage package
        to be a separate module in the Conjury bundle.  This means the
        'find_stage' function is moved too.
        * Implemented 'Glob' argument to the 'dispell' function.
        * Removed support for the --undo option, which was not as well
        designed as one would hope.  The new 'dispell' spell is the right
        thing to use now.

	*  (lib/*/*.pm): Fixed issues with whitespace to make the source
        code more friendly to a wider audience.

	*  (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): Made each Conjury.pl execute in a
	separate temporary package.  This keeps namespace pollution from
	becoming a major problem.

	*  (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): Fixed a typo and improved the POD a
	little.

2000-04-19  james woodyatt  <jhw@wetware.com>

	* (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): PUBLISHED TO CPAN-- $VERSION=1.003
	Requires perl5.005 now.  It never really worked with an earlier
	version.

	* (*):  Updated license to terms that match the 'new and
	improved' BSD-style license, i.e. the advertising clause is
	removed.

	* (lib/Conjury/Core/Prototype.pm): Updated the standard prototype
	functions so that they are more useful.
	
	* (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): Added new spell function
	Conjury::Core::dispell, which is used to for creating spells that
	erase products of other spells.
	* Renamed '$verifier' to '$validator'... describes its purpose
	much more clearly.
	* Minor updates to POD content.
	* Rewrote much of the argument validation code for better
	checking of caller arguments.
	* Changed the semantics of the '--undo' option, which was never
	really well thought out in the first place.  See the POD content
	for details.

2000-01-24  james woodyatt  <jhw@wetware.com>

	* (lib/Conjury/Core/Prototype.pm): Created.

	* (lib/Conjury/Core.pm): Uses Conjury::Core::Prototype for
	parameter syntax checking and uses __PACKAGE__ where appropriate.
